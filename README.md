# Residue-Geometry-Network
Amino acid networks (AANs) abstract the protein structure by recording the amino acid contacts and can provide insight into protein function. The Residue Geometry Network (RGN) is a novel AAN construction technique that employs the rigidity analysis tool, FIRST (http://azte.technologypublisher.com/technology/7041), to build the AAN. We have shown that this new construction can be combined with network theory methods to include the effects of allowed conformal motions and local chemical environments. Importantly, this is done without costly molecular dynamics simulations required by other AAN-related methods, which allows us to analyse large proteins and/or data sets. Random walk simulations using the RGN were also successful in identifying allosteric residues in proteins involved in GPCR signalling (http://www.nature.com/articles/srep33213).
